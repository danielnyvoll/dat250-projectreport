\subsection{React and Tailwind: Frontend Infrastructure}
For our frontend, we chose to use React and Tailwind. React, developed and maintained by Facebook, is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
It allows us to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. 
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that has been gaining popularity for its unique approach to styling web applications. 
Here's a detailed explanation of why React and Tailwind CSS is an excellent choice for the front-end development of our web application:

\subsubsection{Commponent-Based Architecture }

React's core strength lies in its component-based architecture. This approach enables developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state, and then compose them to make complex user interfaces. 
By breaking down the UI into individual components, React promotes reusability, which can significantly speed up development time and reduce code redundancy.

Each component has a well-defined lifecycle, and React provides hooks into these lifecycle events. 
For instance, developers can execute code at the moment a component mounts, updates, or unmounts, giving fine-grained control over its behavior.

\subsubsection{Declarative Nature} 

React is declarative, meaning that developers write code that describes the UI, and React takes care of updating the Document Object Model (DOM) to match that description. 
When the state of a component changes, React updates only the parts of the DOM that have changed. 
This declarative update process simplifies the code and makes it more predictable, which is crucial for the maintainability of large applications.

\subsubsection{Strong Community and Ecosystem} 

React has a large and active community, which translates into a wealth of third-party components, libraries, and tools that extend its capabilities. 
The ecosystem around React includes state management libraries like Redux and MobX, routing solutions like React Router, and numerous other utilities that complement React's feature set.

\subsubsection{Developer Experience} 

Developer experience is another strong suit for React. It offers a robust set of developer tools, including React Developer Tools, which is a browser extension for debugging component trees. 
It also provides meaningful warnings and error messages that help developers quickly identify and resolve issues.

Tailwind CSS enhances developer experience by allowing them to stay in the HTML for the majority of the styling work, which reduces context switching between HTML and CSS files. 
This can lead to faster development cycles and increased productivity. The utility classes are also self-explanatory, which makes the code easier to read and understand at a glance.

\subsubsection{Utility-First Approach} 

Tailwind CSS employs a utility-first approach to styling, which is a significant shift from traditional CSS frameworks that provide UI kits with predefined component styles. 
Instead of using semantic class names tied to specific components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in the markup. This approach makes it incredibly flexible and reduces the need to write custom CSS to an absolute minimum.

\subsubsection{Performance} 

Because Tailwind encourages the use of utility classes, the size of CSS files tends to be smaller, which can lead to performance gains. 
When combined with its JIT compiler, Tailwind generates the minimal amount of CSS needed for a project, leading to faster load times and improved overall performance of the web application.

\subsection{Spring Boot: Back-End Infrastructure}
Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the initial setup and development of new Spring applications.

\subsubsection{Standalone Applications} 

Spring Boot makes it easy to create standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications that can be run directly from the command line without requiring an external web server. 
This is made possible by embedding servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow directly in the application. 
The ability to run as a standalone app simplifies both the development and the deployment processes.

\subsubsection{Opinionated 'Starter' Dependencies} 

To streamline the configuration process, Spring Boot provides a set of 'starter' dependencies that bundle the necessary libraries to get a feature working. 
These starters cover many Spring Boot features, such as data access, messaging, and web services. 
Using starters, you can avoid library version conflicts and ensure that you're using a set of dependencies that Spring Boot has tested and approved.

\subsubsection{Community and Support} 

Spring Boot benefits from the strong support of the vibrant and extensive Spring community. 
There are numerous guides, tutorials, and a comprehensive reference documentation available. 
Moreover, the community support forums and Stack Overflow are active and helpful in solving problems.
