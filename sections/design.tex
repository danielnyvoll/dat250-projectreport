\section{Design}
\label{sec:design}

The architecture of our voting application is built upon a microservice framework, utilizing Spring Boot for the backend services and React for the frontend user interface. This section outlines the high-level architecture and implementation details of the application.

\subsection{Client-Side (Frontend)}
The frontend is implemented using React, which provides:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A dynamic and responsive user interface for end-users.
  \item Modular components that communicate with the backend via RESTful APIs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Server-Side (Backend)}
Powered by Spring Boot, the backend is composed of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Microservices that handle specific business capabilities, running independently and communicating through RabbitMQ for messaging.
  \item A layered architecture comprising Controllers, Services, Repositories, and Models.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Application Layers}
The backend is divided into several layers, each responsible for distinct roles within the application:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Controller Layer}: Manages HTTP requests and responses.
  \item \textbf{Service Layer}: Orchestrates business logic and data flow.
  \item \textbf{Repository Layer}: Provides data access to the database.
  \item \textbf{Model Layer}: Represents the application's domain model.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Management and Storage}
Data persistence is achieved through:
\begin{itemize}
  \item JPA with Hibernate for object-relational mapping and database interactions.
  \item An H2 in-memory database for development, ensuring speed and ease of configuration.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Security and Authentication}
Firebase Authentication is integrated to provide:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Secure authentication mechanisms including social logins and OAuth2 flows.
  \item An abstraction layer for security concerns, allowing focus on core functionalities.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Real-Time Messaging and Updates}
The integration of Dweet.io facilitates:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Real-time messaging capabilities, particularly beneficial for IoT scenarios.
  \item Immediate data update dissemination to clients.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
The application leverages the strengths of its chosen technologies to provide a robust, scalable, and performant system. The architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns, promoting maintainability and flexibility to cater to the evolving requirements of the application.

The example below shows how you may include code. There are similar
styles for many other langages - in case you do not use Java in your
project. You can wrap the listing into a figure in case you need to
refer to it. How to create a figure was shown in Section~\ref{sec:technology}.
