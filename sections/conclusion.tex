In our project, we adeptly leveraged several advanced technologies, each contributing significantly to our application's success. The front end was built using React and Tailwind CSS [11], offering a dynamic and responsive user interface. Despite the learning challenges, their extensive documentation aided our development process.

For the backend, we chose Spring Boot [3], appreciating its robustness and scalability. The learning curve was steep, but its comprehensive features and industry maturity justified our choice. We integrated RabbitMQ [13] for efficient message handling and asynchronous tasks, which, while demanding a deeper understanding of message queuing, proved invaluable.

Our data handling was streamlined using Hibernate [12] and JPA, enhancing our interactions with the database and integrating smoothly with Spring Boot. Lastly, Firebase [10] provided a secure and easy-to-implement authentication framework. This project stands as a testament to the effectiveness of combining modern, robust technologies with sound design and implementation practices to create scalable, efficient, and maintainable software solutions.
